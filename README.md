The entire assessment is complete with backend API proxy implementation for Ramadan times, countdown logic for next event, and with a clean UI.

## Notes
- In the original requirements document uvloop was included in the installations, however it is not supported natively in windows (most likely because you would have used a mac when making the repo), seeing that it isn't required for the backend logic I chose to build the website without it and used other methods for loops.
